## LINCS processing

This is a repository for editing and manipulating The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data. You
can learn more about LINCS by following this [link](https://lincsproject.org/)

For example, you can find tools for filtering data based on different criteria (such as compound, cell line, time, and dose).
